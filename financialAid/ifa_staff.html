				<h1>Andy Ritzman - Financial Aid Administrator</h1>
				<p align="left">Andrew Ritzman is an Information Technology graduate of South Hills, class of 2000.</p>
				<p align="left">Andrew is one of the first faces that people see while visiting South Hills, as he provides each prospective student with a personalized estimate on cost and the aid that they might be eligible to receive. He uses his technical background to monitor the loan and grant originations, along with their respective disbursements. He is the school’s liaison with the students’ various agencies (WIOA, OVR, STEM). He provides the agencies with each student’s cost and applies the funding to their accounts. In conjunction with the IT Department, Andrew provides accurate enrollment status information to the federal government in order to ensure up-to-date loan and grant eligibility for each student, as well as provide a correct starting point for their loan repayment.</p>

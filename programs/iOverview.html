Our small classes allow for plenty of personal attention from your teachers. And our exceptionally responsive staff is here to answer all your questions and provide you with the tools you need to succeed.</p>
				<h2>Extraordinary Teachers</h2>

And with their uncommonly deep experience working in the field, our teachers are great professional mentors, too.</p>
				<h2>Practical Curriculum</h2>
				<p align="left">"No fluff; no filler!" That's South Hills' academic motto number one. "Learn by doing!" is number two. All our programs deliver the material you really need to know to launch a successful career in your chosen field. And we believe the best way to do that is through hands-on, project-oriented learning.</p>
